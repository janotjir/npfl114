### Assignment: crac2023
#### Date: Deadline: Evaluation Jun 1-15

If you would like to try participating in a real shared task,
right now [CRAC 2023 Shared Task on Multilingual Coreference Resolution](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/corefud/crac23)
is running, with the evaluation phase in Jun 1-15.

The goal is to perform coreference resolution on 17 datasets in 12 languages,
where coreference resolution is the task of clustering together multiple
mentions of the same entity appearing in a textual document (e.g., `Joe Biden`,
`the U.S. President`, and `he`).

Note that if you send a solution, you would ideally also send an accompanying
“system description” paper – that requires some work, but you would have
a published paper.
